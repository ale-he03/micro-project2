You will create a MongoDB, Express, and Node.js application:

Consider using the ES module import/export statements
Install the full Express required and recommended dependencies: 
Install Express, dotenv, mongoose as full dependences 
Install Nodemon as development dependency only
Following the MEN folder structure, add all required folders and place each JS file in its corresponding folder as explained in the lecture
Connect your application with your Atlas cloud MongoDB. Make sure to place the connection string in a safe file and just include it within your application as explained in our lecture
Prepare a good professional schema for your collection (add some rules and validation) for demonstration
Your collection in MongoDB [table in SQL] should contain at least five fields (5 keys with their values)
